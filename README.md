# Mobile-Security-GuessMeApp
***Short Video about the App: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn7v3BhCVk8***

We were asked to create an app that would be as difficult as possible for anyone trying to connect.
To make it harder I chose to use several sensors:Temperature,Lights,Accelerometer and Proximity.
as you can see i create bound service to each sensor and i defined wich paramters of each sensor is what you have to do for login.

but it's not the end also i measure the status of the battery.
and you need at least 5 contacts to login.
